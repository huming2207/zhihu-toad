	‘A historic event’ or ‘an historic event’?
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
		People often believe that they should use the

		<em>
			an

			historic
			<i class="icon-external">

				horrific
				<i class="icon-external">

		 or

			hotel
			<i class="icon-external">

		</a>
		. Are they right or wrong? Should you say ‘an historic event’ or ‘a historic event’?
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		<u>
			<em>
				An
			</em>
			 is the form of the indefinite article that is used before a spoken 
			<a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/vowel" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">
				vowel
				<i class="icon-external">

			</a>
			 sound: it doesn’t matter how the written word in question is actually spelled. 
		</u>
		So, we say ‘
		<em>
			an
		</em>
		<a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/honour" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">

		</a>
		’, ‘
		<em>
			an
		</em>
		 hour’, or ‘
		<em>
			an
		</em>
		 heir’, for example, because the initial letter ‘h’ in all three words is not actually pronounced. By 
		<a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/contrast" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">
			contrast

			</i>
		</a>
		 we say ‘
		<em>
			a
		</em>
		 hair’ or ‘
		<em>
			a
		</em>
		 horse’ because, in these cases, the ‘h’ 
		<em>
			is
		</em>
		 pronounced.
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		Let’s go back to those three words that tend to cause problems: 
		<em>
			historic, horrific,
		</em>
		 and 
		<em>
			hotel
		</em>
		. If 
		<em>
			hotel 
		</em>
		was pronounced without its 
		<a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/initial" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">
			initial
			<i class="icon-external">
			</i>
		</a>
		 letter ‘h’ (i.e. as if it were spelled ‘otel’), then it would be correct to use 
		<em>
			an
		</em>
		 in front of it. The same is true of 
		<em>
			historic
		</em>
		 and 
		<em>
			horrific
		</em>
		.
		<u>
			 If 
			<em>
				horrific
			</em>
			 was pronounced ‘orrific’ and 
			<em>
				historic
			</em>
			 was pronounced ‘istoric’ then it would be 
			<a href="http://link.zhihu.com/?target=http%3A//www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/appropriate" class=" wrap external" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">
				appropriate
				<i class="icon-external">
				</i>
			</a>
			 to refer to ‘an istoric occasion’ or ‘an orrific accident’.
		</u>
		<b>
			In the 18th and 19th centuries, people often did pronounce these words in this way.
		</b>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p>
		<b>
			Today, though, these three words are generally pronounced with a spoken ‘h’ at the beginning and so it’s now more logical to refer to ‘a hotel’, ‘a historic event’, or ‘a horrific accident’.
