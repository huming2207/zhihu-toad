<br>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		There's a boy across the street, lately he's looked very 
		<b>
			neat
		</b>
		<br>
		
Seems he's always on the 
		<b>
			run
		</b>
		, down the street to 301
		<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Saturday he mows the lawn, it's about a crack of dawn
		<br>
		
Nine o'clock the work's all done, down the street to 301
		<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		When it's back to school this fall, winter's chill may end it all
		<br>
		
But for now there's lots of fun, with the girl at 301
		<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Maybe they will never wed, sure they may break up instead
		<br>
		
But for now she is the one, the girl who lives at 301
		<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		The boy who lives across the street has a reason 
		<b>
			to be neat
		</b>
		<br>
		
He's in love and on the 
		<b>
			run
		</b>
		, with the girl at 301
		<br>
		<br>
	</p>
	<p>
		Don't you tell 'em to beware of a summer love affair
		<br>
		
You know she's his only one, the girl that lives at 301
	</p>
	<br>
